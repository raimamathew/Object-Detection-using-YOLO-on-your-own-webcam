WARN.PY
Using the code 'warn.py', we can access the label of the object in the real-time video and show any warning window if necessary. For example, if there is a bomb or any explosive in the real-time video, we can show a warning sign. In this case, I have taken clock (obviously because I dont have an explosive xD). 

If a clock appears in the screen, the previous window closes and there is a red screen that appears.

WEBCAM.PY

In this code, you can see the labels and confidence of the objects that appear in the real-time video.
